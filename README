This is a python script for automatic satellite tracking using funcube dongle, 
gnuradio and a modified version of GPredict with Open Sound Control message
sending (https://github.com/ladecadence/GPredict---OSC)

The script receives OSC messages from gpredict, with the data of the satellites
selected in the active module, checking if there's a satellite in the visible 
sky. If there's one, starts the gnuradio receiver for that satellite (right
now, FM downlinks and CW beacons are supported) so you can listen them. The
script does automatic doppler correction for the satellite frequency.

This script can also control the OpenRotor (AZ/EL rotor that can be made in a 
FabLab) attached to a USB port of the computer running it.
